# Intro to data visualization using Python
An introductory workshop on data visualization with Python. This workshop will give you the tools you need to create complex and beautiful data visualizations with the Altair library. Weâ€™ll cover Python basics before diving into DataFrames, HTTP requests, JSON, and data visualizations. We will use data from NYC Open data, along with COVID data from an external API. This the perfect workshop for those with no Python experience. More information about the workshop event can be found [here](https://csc.barnard.edu/events/workshop-introduction-python-data-visualization).

Note: You will need to download and run the notebook locally (or inside a Colab Notebook) to see the Altair charts (they do not render within the repository).
